    "description" : "Welcome to the reference for the Leegality REST API!\n\nYou can use our API for creating, editing and deleting Signing invitations; for fetching Documents, Audit Trails and other details for existing invitations; and for searching documents based on your custom query.\n\nThe API is based on REST principles, and is a JSON-backed interface.\n## Integration Flow\nIn terms of the flow-\n\n1. The first step is to create a Sign Invitation by making a POST call to the Create API from your back-end server.      \n\n    a. One Sign Invitation can be used to get a single PDF file eSigned.\n\n    b. You can add any number of signers to an invitation. A signer is called an invitee. By default, a signer order is assigned to the request as per which the invitations of subsequent invitees are only activated on successful eSigning by the previous invitees. You can also deactivate Signing order if your use case so requires.\n\n    c. You need to mandatorily pass the Name, email and/or phone number of the invitee to create an invitation for the invitee.\n\n    d.  You also need to pass the PDF file to be signed in Base64 format, or pass a Template ID along with the Template Key Values after obtaining the same from your Dashboard.\n\n    e. You can configure the signature type and other configurations for every invitee while create the invitation.\n\n    f. In case you want to use a Stamp Paper for a document, you need to pass the relevant Stamp Series ID after obtaining the same from your Dashboard. Please note that you need to pre-purchase a particular number of Stamps from your Dashboard to be able to use this functionality.\n\n2. In response to a successful call in the previous step, you will receive a Document ID and Signing URL in reponse.\n\n    Signing URL is a unique user-specific URL created for every request. The user can sign the document from this URL. You have various ways of sending the user to this URL to eSign the document.    \n\n    a. You can use our Front-end Web and Mobile SDKs to open the URL from within your application.\n\n    b. You can redirect the user to the URL and have him redirected back to the redirection URL set by you on completion or error.\n\n    c. You can set that the URLs created be automatically sent to their email/phone to complete the process outside your application.\n3. On successful signing, a notification with the updated document is sent to the Success Webhook set by you for every particular invitee. In case of error, the notification is sent to a separate Error Webhook provided by you.\n\n    Alternatively, you can also make a GET call to the Details API with the relvant Document ID to check the status of the invitation and/or to fetch the document.    \n\n    a. Once a document is successfully signed by all assigned invitees, it is considered as completed and an audit trail is generated for the particular document. The Audit Trail is sent to the success Webhook on successful signing by the last invitee, and can also alternatively be fetched by calling the Details API once the document has been completed.    \n\n    b. Completed documents are also saved in your Dashboard by default. By enforcing the Delete on Complete functionality from the Dashboard or while create the Signing Request , you can program the documents to automatically get deleted from your Dashboard after 7 days of completion.    \n\n    c.  A URL of the signed document is also sent to all the signers by default for them to view, download or delete the signed document. In case, Delete on Complete functionality is turned on, the URL automatically expires after 7 days of completion unless express saved by the user in his Leegality Account.\n    \n## Account Authentication\n1. You need to obtain an “Auth Token” from the API Settings Tab from your Leegality dashboard to be able to interact with our API.\n2. You can also optionally whitelist the IPs from where you want to interact with our APIs. The same can be done from the API Settings Tab as well. It is highly recommended that you do so before going live.\n3. To verify Webhook calls, you can verify the value of the MAC key in Webhook calls. The value of mac is calculated by applying HMAC-SHA1 algorithm on documentId with your Private Salt provided in your API Settings Tab. You can use it to ensure that the calls are coming from our servers.\n## Types of eSign\n1. Essential Plan customers can use Aadhaar eSign (OTP and Biometric), VirtualSign and DSC.\n2. Business and Corporate Plan customers in addition can also use Document Signer Certificate and Automated Signer using Virtual Sign or Document Signer Certificate.\n\n   ### Aadhaar eSign\n   \n    Aadhaar eSign is an Aadhaar authentication based digital signature which can be carried out using the Aadhaar OTP or Aadhaar Biometric verification method. For Aadhaar biometric, you need to procure a Aadhaar registered Biometric Device. The same can be either used from a Windows PC or a Android Device (using our Android Biometric SDK)\n    \n   ### Virtual Sign \n    \n    Virtual Sign is an Mobile/Email OTP based authentication for approval of a document.\n\n   ### DSC \n   \n    DSC is a USB-dongle based technique of digitally signing a document. The signer needs to install Leegality's USB Signing Utility in their PC and need to possess a USB Dongle with a valid Digital Signature Certificate issued by a Certifying Authority.\n\n   ### Document Signer Certificate \n   \n    Document Signer Certificate is a certificate issued to an Organisation for server based signing of documents. To use the same, you need to place a validly issued Document Signer Certificate on your server along with Leegality's Document Signer Utility, and then configure the same from your Dashboard.\n    \n   ### Automated Signer \n   \n    Automated Signing can be carried out either using a Document Signer Certificate or a Virtual Signature pre-configured with any user in your organisational account with Leegality.\n\n## Branding\n  \n1. You can upload your Organisational Logo under ‘Branding Logo’ in your Settings Page to replace the Leegality Default Logo on all signing pages.\n2. You can update your organisation’s name under ‘Branding Name’ in your Settings Page to be used in email and phone communication to your users.\n3. Corporate and Business users can also use a custom sub-domain and custom color for their Organisation.\n## Templates\nYou can create a Template from your Dashboard from the in-built Word Processor, setup custom fields and then use the same to automically generate a PDF file for eSigning.You can obtain a Template ID and sample JSON with the Field Keys to use while create an eSigning Request.\n\n## Stamps\nIn case you want to use Stamp Papers for your Documents, you need to purchase the desired number of Stamp Papers for the desired State from your Dashboard. Once a request is placed, you can obtain the Stamp Series ID and pass the same while create the Signing Request. We will automatically use the latest available Stamp Paper from the Series and merge the same with your Document.\n## Expiry\nEvery signing Request has an expiry period within which the document must be signed. If the document is not signed by the invitees within the expiry period, the invitation is cancelled and the transaction is reversed. If the invitation is signed by one invitee before the expiry period but has more pending invitations even after the expiry period, the invitaion remains in Sent state and need to be manually activated again- either from the Dashboard or calling the edit API. Error Webhooks are called on expiry of every invitation.\n## Wallet usage\nOn successful request creation, the respective transaction charge is reserved from your Wallet. Once the signature is actually carried out the reserved balance is used. If the invitation expires, the balance reserved for the expired invitations is moved back. In case of a Stamped document, the Stamp Paper is reversed in case no invitee signed the document. If even a single invitee successfully signed the document, the Stamp Paper cannot be reused.\n## Updates and Notifications\nYou can subscribe to the receive updates on the changes made to this API reference from your Notifications Tab in your Production Dashboard.\nFor more details, access our FAQs page.\n## Resources\n\n  Web SDK (Front-end) - http://gitlab.leegality.com/leegality-public/web-sdk\n\n  Android SDK (Front-end) - http://gitlab.leegality.com/leegality-public/android-sdk \n\n  Android Biometric SDK (APK file for Front-end Integration) - http://gitlab.leegality.com/leegality-public/leegality-helper \n\n  iOS SDK (Front end) - http://gitlab.leegality.com/leegality-public/ios-sdk \n\n  Document Signer Server Utility (Backend) - Contact us for the same. \n\n  USB Dongle Utility (Windows and Mac Desktop Utility) - Contact us for the same.\n\n  Sandbox Dashboard - https://sandbox.leegality.com \n\n  Sandbox Base URL - https://sandbox.leegality.com/api/v2.1 \n\n  Production Dashboard - https://app.leegality.com \n\n  Production Base URL - https://app.leegality.com/api/v2.1",
